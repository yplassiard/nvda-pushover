# NVDA PushOver Add-on
This NVDA Add-on is used to communicate with the PushOver service (https://pushover.net) acting as a Desktop client to receive and manage notifications.
## Setup
- On add-on installation, you need to log in to PushOver service using NVDA's PushOver preference dialog.
- Then, assign a gesture to the desired actions within the NVDA gesture dialog.

## Development status and target audience
This is Alpha stage stuff. If you do not know about PushOver service, this add-on is most probably useless for you.
